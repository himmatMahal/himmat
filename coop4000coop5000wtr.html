                        internship at SAP through the University of Guelph&#x27;s Job portal. After a very friendly and
                        pleasant interview experience, I was offered an internship at SAP a software developer on the
                        cloud reliability team, one of the various teams in the Waterloo office. SAP is a multinational
                        software company and this would be my first internship working at such a large company so I was
                        thrilled to receive an offer and gladly accepted</p>

                                    knowledge by taking an online k8s course, from a library of courses offered to SAP
                                    employees. This helped fill some gaps in my k8s knowledge before starting on my
                                    internship project. The project I worked on involved essentially using ephemeral
                                    containers to debug unhealthy database pods. This was a great opportunity to learn
                                    how to use such a powerful feature in Kubernetes. Also while working on this
                                    project, there were many times I had to use kubectl (the k8s command line tool) to
                                    interact with Kubernetes clusters, which also contributed to my learning.</li>

                                    had to email colleagues internationally to ask about how they approached a similar
                                    problem to what our team was facing. I also had to go through trial and error,
                                    asking the team for feedback on my work, and do research online.</li>

                                <li style="list-style-type:disc">Go is a programming language known for many things,
                                    including itâ€™s support for concurrency, static typing, and fast compilation. For
                                    this and many other reasons, it is a commonly used language for developing cloud
                                    services, including those that run in k8s clusters. The main cloud service I worked
                                    on was written in go which was very exciting since I was previously interested in
                                    learning the language.</li>

                                    wrote down notes. All of this helped me learn Go little-by-little, until I felt
                                    comfortable making some basic Go changes and testing them out. Feedback from my
                                    teammates on pull requests, as well as simply asking them questions also helped
                                    improve my understanding of Go.</li>

                                    features. Nonetheless, every time I made a change, I tested it to make sure it was
                                    working as expected. Sometimes I even caught errors in my own code and was able to
                                    fix these. Changes were tested at multiple levels; including end-to-end tests,
                                    integration tests, unit tests, and I made sure to manually test my changes as well.
